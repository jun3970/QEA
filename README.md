## Modeling the impact of quarterly earnings announcement on stock daily returns

### Abstract

This paper aims to illustrate the different patterns of the effects, 
attributed to quarterly earnings announcement, among grouped stocks daily returns.
The empirical study finds that, in Chinese A-share markets, 
the release of corporate earnings indeed produce significant abnormal returns, 
which are not captured by the Fama-French five factor model .
It is worth noting that the group membership of stocks in the sample 
are data-determined, relying on an iterative algorithm called PLS from Su(2016),
which impose penalty on the heterogeneous coefficients of market risk factor.
